This website was desingned for educational purposes only for the Code Institute by Holly Horwood.  All best endevours have been made to ensure all content has been obtained legally and and all good practice guide lines for web development have been followed.

Motivation:
A life long love of horses and working with them lead me to create this website.  I have for the past couple of years had a strong interest in the relatively new sport of Working Equitation.  Been involved with horse and horse people means I have a lot of knowledge in this area and I know what is impotant to people from the equine world.  I understand what they are wanting to find out when looking on line for certain subjects and knew I could create a user friendly website that would help them to find the answers they were looking for.  I also could source a lot of content myself through friends in my area I have ridden with over the years.
